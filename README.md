#############################QRCode Based ATM(Smart-ATM)######################################

Are you too afraid to take the risk of touching the ATM screen during the Pandemic? Then the SmartATM is for you. Perform all the major transactions like withdraw, deposit, 
balance enquiry without even touching the ATM screen because you never know proper precautions were taken before hand to keep the ATM clean.
Due to the pandemic, the use of ATM's has gone down drastically since people are afraid that they might catch the virus by touchiing the not-so-properly sanitized ATM screen.
SmartATM can help the ATM pick back the pace by ensuring the safety of the customers.

Steps to be performed to use the app:
1--> Open the mobile app while in ATM
2--> Swipe your card (I have used a desktop application as a simulator for actual ATM)
3 -- >The simulator generates the Barcode
4 --> Scan the barcode from your Smart ATM mobile application
5--> Enter the pin and proceed with the normal ATM transactions

Technologies used for front end - Mobile application:  React Native and expo

Steps to make the project up and running: (Prerequiste : Make sure you have expo installed. Look at expo documentation on how to install)
1--> Clone the project and install all the dependencies by typing npm install iin the cmd
2--> Open cmd in the path and type npm start
3--> Scan the barcode generated from the expo mobile app

Done!!  You have the app running on your mobile. Happy coding
